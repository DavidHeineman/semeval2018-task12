<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
	This is the CodaLab Competition for SemEval-2018 Task 12: The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task.
</p>

<h4>Task</h4>

<p>Given an argument consisting of a <strong>claim</strong> and a <strong>reason</strong>, the goal is to select the correct <strong>warrant</strong> that explains reasoning of this particular argument. There are only two options given and only one answer is correct.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> There She Is, Miss America</p>
<p><strong>Additional info:</strong> In 1968, feminists gathered in Atlantic City to protest the Miss America pageant, calling it racist and sexist. Is this beauty contest bad for women?)</p>

<p><strong>Argument: </strong> Miss America gives honors and education scholarships. And since ..., Miss America is good for women.</p>
<ul>
	<li>a) scholarships would give women a chance to study</li>
	<li>b) scholarships would take women from the home</li>
</ul>

<p>Only (a) fills the gap in this argument; (b) would in fact lead to the opposite claim (such that Miss America is not good for women)</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Reasoning is a crucial part of natural language argumentation. In order to comprehend an argument, one has to reconstruct and analyze its reasoning. As arguments are highly contextualized, most reasoning-related content is left implicit and usually presupposed. Thus, argument comprehension requires not only language understanding and logic skills, but it also heavily depends on common sense. We define a new task, argument reasoning comprehension. Given a natural language argument with a reason and a claim, the goal is to choose the correct implicit reasoning from two options. The challenging factor is that both options are plausible and lexically very close while leading to contradicting claims. We created a new freely licensed dataset based on authentic arguments from news comments.</p>
