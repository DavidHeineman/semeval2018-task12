<h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>

<p>Systems participating in the task must classify all instances in the test data set.</p>

<p>The classification results for must be submitted in a delimited text file named <samp>answer.txt</samp>. Each line consists of two fields separated by horizontal whitespace (a single tab or space character). The first field is the instance ID. The second field is either 0 (which means that <samp>warrant0</samp> is the predicted answer) or 1 (which means that <samp>warrant1</samp> is the predicted answer).</p>

<p>Sample data, result files, and scorer are available on <a href="https://github.com/habernal/semeval2018-task12">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To submit the results, place <samp>answer.txt</samp> in a ZIP file (in the top-level directory), and then upload it to CodaLab according to the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/wiki/User_Participating-in-a-Competition">Participating in a Competition</a>.

<p>Systems will be scored using accuracy (<samp> accuracy = correct predictions / all instances</samp>).</p>
